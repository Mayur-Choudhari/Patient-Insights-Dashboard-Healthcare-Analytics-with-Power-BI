# Patient Insights Dashboard

### Project Overview

The Patient Insights Dashboard is an interactive healthcare data visualization project built using Power BI. The goal of this project is to provide actionable insights into patient details, medical test results, and hospitalization data to enhance decision-making for healthcare professionals.

### Project Highlights

#### Domain: Healthcare Analytics.

#### *Tools Used: Power BI.*

#### Data Operations:

- Merged and joined two datasets for a comprehensive view.

- Transformed binary data (e.g., smoker, alcohol consumption, CKD, chest infection, heart failure) from 0/1 values into more meaningful Yes/No categories.

- Created a calculated column for Stay Duration using the formula: DATEDIFF([D.O.A], [D.O.D], DAY).

- Cleaned and prepared the data to ensure consistency and accuracy.

#### Visual Features:

- Displays general patient details such as age, gender, admission and discharge dates.

- Test reports including Hemoglobin (HB), Glucose, Platelets, Urea, Creatinine, and more.

- Patient outcomes and conditions, such as ICU duration and discharge status.

**Key Visuals**

#### General Details:

- Patient demographics and admission data.

- Test Reports:

- Vital medical indicators displayed for quick assessment.

#### Doctorâ€™s Note:

- Summary of the patient's current health status and recommendations.

### Dashboard Use Case

#### This dashboard helps:

- **Doctors:** Quickly assess a patientâ€™s condition and medical history.

- **Hospital Management:** Monitor patient outcomes and hospitalization metrics.

- **Data Analysts:** Analyze trends in patient care and medical test results.

#### How to Access the Project

- Clone or download this repository.

- Open the Power BI (.pbix) file using Power BI Desktop.

- Explore the pre-built dashboard to review patient data.

#### Key Learnings

- Data Transformation: Enhanced raw data readability by converting binary fields to categorical values (e.g., Smoker: 1 -> Yes).

- Calculated Columns: Added a calculated column to derive the duration of hospital stays.

- Data Visualization: Created a clean, intuitive, and interactive dashboard to present complex healthcare data.

- Healthcare Knowledge: Gained insights into hospital operations and patient test reports.

#### Future Scope

- Integration with Python: To perform advanced data cleaning and preprocessing.

- Additional Visuals: Incorporate trends and predictive analytics for patient outcomes.

- Dynamic Inputs: Add filters for customized views based on specific criteria.
